## IDENTITY APPLICATION
    
    I have created a new project.This is an authentication application. 
    In this application,if user does not an account then user can create an account and login.
    
### Firebase
    
    Firebase is a mobile backend-as a service that provides powerful features for building mobile applications. 
    Firebase has three core services. They are a real time database, user authentication and hosting.
      
    I create an account from Google Firebase and i started to use it in my applications.

                                                    Table-1

    
### Login Success
    
    If user can log in successfully with no error, user can see new screen and the screen includes a text.
    The text is “Congrats you logged in successfully with no error”. 
    But first of all user have to sign to this application.Here Google Firebase system helps.

                                                    Table-2

    User can create an account by using Firebase. 
    Then Firebase saves the informations which belong users to own database.
  
    If users want to log in to this application Firebase checks the informations which are e-mail and password.
    If the emails and password pair then user can login successfully,
    but if they dont pair then user get authentication fail.

        Table-3 (if user can not login succesfully, app shows “Authentication failed” text) 



## IDENTITY APPLICATION DESIGN

    First of all, i have started to design banner part.
    If user can login successfully with no errors, the screen changes but banner part does not changes.
    So i designed the banner part for every function. Later i have used e-mail and password input-box.![login form](https://user-
    Lastly i have adjusted colors and background colors.
